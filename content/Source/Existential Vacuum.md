A state of meaninglessness or feeling of emptiness that people might experience when they lack purpose or direction in life.

## Causes

#### Loss of Traditional Values
As societies modernize and traditional structures like religion or family bonds weaken, people may struggle to find alternative sources of meaning.
#### Excessive Freedom Without Purpose
In the absence of clear goals or frameworks, individuals might experience "paralysis of choice" or feel aimless.

#### Materialism and Disconnection
A focus on material success or superficial goals often fails to provide deep, enduring fulfillment.

## Examples
#### Youth in Transition
- Young adults may experience an existential vacuum when transitioning into adulthood, especially if societal pressures to "find a passion" or "make an impact" leave them feeling overwhelmed or inadequate.
- Example: A college graduate who feels paralyzed by choices and says, "I don’t know what I want to do with my life."

#### Midlife Crisis
- A person in middle age reflects on their life and feels they've wasted time pursuing goals that don’t bring true satisfaction.
- Example: A man in his 40s who suddenly quits his job and buys a motorcycle, hoping to reignite a sense of purpose.

## Overcoming
Frankl suggested several ways to combat the existential vacuum:
- **Finding Meaning**: Engage in activities or relationships that resonate deeply with your values and sense of purpose.
- **Creating Purpose**: Take up meaningful challenges, set goals, or help others to generate a sense of contribution.
- **Accepting Responsibility**: Embrace the freedom to choose your attitude and actions in any given circumstance.
- **Cultivating Gratitude**: Focus on the small joys of life to foster a deeper appreciation of existence.
