**Logotherapy** is a form of existential psychotherapy developed by **Viktor E. Frankl**, an Austrian neurologist, psychiatrist, and Holocaust survivor. It focuses on finding meaning in life as the central human motivation. 
## Core Principles

#### The Will to Meaning
 Unlike Freud's "will to pleasure" or Adler's "will to power," logotherapy is centered on the belief that the primary drive in humans is the pursuit of meaning in life.
 
#### Freedom of Will
Individuals have the freedom to choose their attitudes and responses to life's challenges, even in the face of suffering.
#### Meaning in Life
Life has meaning under all circumstances, even in suffering or unavoidable hardship. Frankl believed that discovering this meaning could help individuals endure difficulties and thrive.
