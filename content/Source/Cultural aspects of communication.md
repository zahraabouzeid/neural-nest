## Cultural Orientations by Karl-Heinz Flechsig

The model of **cultural orientations** (kulturelle Orientierungen) was developed by Karl Heinz Flechsig, a university professor in GÃ¶ttingen. It is a model that can be used regardless of explicitly defined cultures. It describes cultures in a contrastive way. You can use it to diagnose conflicts between cultures.

#### Communication
**High Context Communication:**
- Indirect communication style.
- Requires extensive contextual information for relationship building.
- Personal relationships crucial for business dealings.
- Non-verbal elements (body language, facial expressions, eye contact) are significant.
- Previous encounters, status, and mutual friends influence communication.
- Messages can be implicit, requiring reading between the lines.

**Low Context Communication:**
- Direct communication style.
- Minimal contextual information needed for conversation.
- Business relationships are impersonal, with little emphasis on trust-building.
- Focus is on business and factual information.
- Verbal communication is explicit - what is said is what is meant.
- Communication seen as a straightforward exchange of information.

#### Ideas about Time
**Fixed vs. Fluid Concept of Time:**
- Fixed concept emphasizes punctuality, with meetings and tasks expected to start and finish on time.
- Fluid concept de-emphasizes punctuality, with a more relaxed attitude toward meeting start times and delays considered normal.

**Cultural Variations in Time Orientation:**
- Different cultures have varied orientations toward the past, present, or future.
- Past-oriented cultures judge plans and changes based on historical congruence and tradition.
- Present-oriented cultures focus on short-term usefulness and immediate consequences.
- Future-oriented cultures assess plans, events, and changes for long-term consequences and expected benefits.

**Corporate Time Perspectives:**
- Future-oriented companies seek innovation and market trends.
- Past-oriented companies value tradition and historical experiences in decision-making.

#### Individualism and Collectivism
**Individualism:**
- Loose social ties characterize individualistic cultural orientation.
- Emphasis on independence; individuals are expected to take care of themselves.
- Priority on personal identity; "I" is more important than "we."
- Value placed on honesty, with personal identity seen as a sign of honesty.
- Political equality, where laws are the same for everyone, and individuals participate equally.
- Economic motivation tied to performance and power increase in a company.
- Conflicts are considered unavoidable in individualistic cultures.

**Collectivism:**
- In collectivistic cultures, individuals subordinate their interests to the community.
- Community support is reciprocated for obedience and truthfulness.
- Priority on the collective identity; "we" is more important than "I."
- Loyalty is expressed by saying what everyone thinks.
- Political power often centralized in a leader articulating collective goals.
- Economic motivation stems from a sense of togetherness; social ties are crucial.
- Company-employee relationships are likened to family ties, and conflicts are to be avoided.

## German Culture
- **Communication Style:** The emphasis on punctuality and the importance of deadlines align with a more fixed concept of time, which is often associated with German culture.
- **Individualism vs. Collectivism:** The text on individualism and collectivism suggests that German culture may lean towards individualism. The emphasis on personal identity, honesty, and the "I" being more important than the "we" reflects individualistic tendencies.
- **Economic and Work Values:** The idea that motivation in economic settings is tied to performance and an increase in power aligns with aspects of German work culture, which often values efficiency and productivity.
- **Company Culture:** The notion that conflicts in a company are seen as unavoidable resonates with a pragmatic and direct communication style that is often associated with German work environments.
- **Political and Legal Structure:** The text mentions that politically, laws are the same for everyone, and all individuals participate equally. This aligns with principles of equality and fairness, which are often emphasized in German society.

## Working abroad

First of all, I want to state that I have already decided to move to Germany in order to live, work, and study. All things considered, the experience has been interesting and rewarding. It was a fascinating opportunity to adjust to a new culture. Despite requiring some adjustment, the German work environment's emphasis on efficiency and punctuality ultimately helped me approach my work in a more disciplined manner.

Moreover, understanding the German way of life has been the main key to align with German cultural and social norms. Every aspect of daily life in Germany possesses its own unique challenges, accompanied by a set of new values. One example that demonstrates this point is the precise sorting of rubbish for recycling, which is a very important practice in the German community.

Furthermore, learning German was first challenging, but I embraced the opportunity to learn it. Not only did this open up new avenues for communication, but it also allowed me to connect more deeply with the local community.

Additionally, developing a professional network required not just comprehending German business etiquette but also realizing the value of interpersonal connections at work. The idea of work-life balance changed, placing more emphasis on the importance of family and leisure time.

To sum up, I recognize the profound impact of considering and embracing cultural differences. The move to Germany has not only advanced my career but has also provided a unique and transformative cultural experience that continues to shape both my personal and professional growth.

## Integration between Nations

Firstly, national integration through cultural exchange can be developed by promoting open-mindedness, embracing diversity, and encouraging cross-cultural interactions. Initiatives such as cultural festivals, language exchange programs, and collaborative artistic projects create spaces for people from different nations to share and appreciate each other's traditions. Education about diverse cultures and histories helps break down stereotypes, raising mutual understanding. By celebrating common humanity while respecting unique identities, nations can build bridges that promote unity and harmony.

Secondly, promoting effective communication involves engaging with others on the same eye level, fostering mutual respect, and embracing acceptance. By establishing a shared ground where everyone's perspectives are acknowledged and valued, we create an environment that encourages open dialogue and understanding. Treating each person with respect, regardless of differences, contributes to a culture of inclusivity, where diverse voices are heard and appreciated.

In conclusion, successful communication is a key factor in enhancing our understanding of each other's cultures. Respecting others and adapting our way of thinking and behaving to align with their values could be the solution to this issue. In other words, we are all humans, expecting that others value our presence.
