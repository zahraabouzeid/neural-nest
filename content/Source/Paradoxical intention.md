Frankl uses paradoxical intention to help reverse his patients’ anticipatory anxiety. By asking his patients to try to do that which they fear doing, Frankl demonstrates that their anxieties actually hurt them rather than help them. For example, Frankl might tell someone with a severe stutter to try his best to stutter the next time he spoke to someone. When that person tries to stutter, he discovers that he cannot do so.
